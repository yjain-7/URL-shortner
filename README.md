# URL-shortner
A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and generates a shortened version of it, which is easier to share and remember. In this article, we will be implementing a basic URL shortener using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles

Create a concrete class which implements a short URL interface class provided. It contains all the methods that can be used to create long URL to short URL mappings.
Implement a method to take a long URL as input, generate a random 9 character short URL and return it. Also maintain this mapping using a hash map for quick retrieval.
Implement a method to take a long URL and a custom short URL as input and register that mapping. 
Error handling to make sure each long URL maps to only one short URL and vice versa.
Implement a method to lookup short URL for a given long URL, from the mapping created.
Implement a method to delete the mapping based on a long URL.
Implement a counter to keep track of the hit count for each long URL - which tells us how many times a particular long URL has been looked up.
Test these methods using test cases.
